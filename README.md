# PB Sandwich
Turn your typical WordPress visual editor into a super charged visual-editor-page-builder hybrid

* Create columns straight from the editor, no shortcodes necessary
* Drag and drop galleries, videos, audio and containers into other locations
* Edit your content like you normally would
* Blends perfectly with [Shortcake](https://github.com/fusioneng/Shortcake)

It lets you do this while editing posts and pages:

You'll get this as your output:

# Usage

1. Download the zip from the right side of this page

3. Create/edit a page or post
4. Create shortcodes (via shortcake), add a media or create a column

* [Report bugs](https://github.com/gambitph/Page-Builder-Sandwich/issues) that you may encounter, this is quite new so I'm betting there're some
* We're looking to add common shortcodes via Shortcake to be included in the page builder. [Pull requests on new shortcodes](https://github.com/gambitph/Page-Builder-Sandwich/pulls) are very welcome.
