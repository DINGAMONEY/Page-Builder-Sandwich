# PB Sandwich
*Turn your typical WordPress visual editor into a super charged visual-editor-page-builder hybrid*

One of the most frustrating things when creating content is layouting and writing them.

Sure you can use **shortcodes columns**, but are not user friendly with all those distracting square brackets. They look great in the frontend, but they are not actual columns in the backend. Existing **Page builders** are also great, but we didn't want to hijack the content editor and we wanted to find a way to do it using the existing visual editor that everyone knows.

# Goal

The goal is to create a page builder that
* Feels and acts *native* and part of WordPress
* Not clunky and doesn't pollute *much*
* Leaves *most* of the content working fine event if the plugin is deactivated or deleted
* Lazy, no settings pages specific for the plugin

# What you can do with it

* Create columns straight from the editor, no shortcodes necessary
* Drag and drop TinyMCE views into other locations. Works with:
  * WordPress image galleries,
  * Jetpack video embeds,
  * Jetpack audio embeds,
  * Shortcake
* Edit your content like you normally would
* Blends perfectly with [Shortcake](https://github.com/fusioneng/Shortcake) & Jetpack

# Preview

# Contributing

* [Report bugs](https://github.com/gambitph/Page-Builder-Sandwich/issues) that you may encounter, this is quite new so I'm betting there're some
* We're looking to add common shortcodes via Shortcake to be included in the page builder. [Pull requests on new shortcodes](https://github.com/gambitph/Page-Builder-Sandwich/pulls) are very welcome.
