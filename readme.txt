Create columns striaght in the visual editor without using any shortcodes

== Description ==

One of the most frustrating things when creating content is layouting them by creating columns.

Sure you can use shortcodes, but are not user friendly. They look great in the frontend, but they are not actual columns in the backend. Page builders are great, but we wanted to find a way to do it using the existing visual editor everyone knows.

Check out the screenshots to see how Shortcodeless Columns works.

= Features =

* Adds a column button in the content editor when in visual mode
* Columns show up within the content editor as columns
* Edit your column contents directly without any shortcode fuss
* Ability to add 2, 3, 4 or custom width columns
* Nestable columns
* Percentages are used on column widths to make them flexible
* Includes column margins
* Clean output: columns are rendered as floating divs
* Works great with [Shortcake](https://github.com/fusioneng/Shortcake)
