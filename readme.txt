Turn your visual editor into a page builder hybrid

== Description ==

= PB Sandwich for short =

One of the most frustrating things when creating content is layouting and writing them.

Sure you can use shortcodes columns, but are not user friendly with all those distracting square brackets. They look great in the frontend, but they are not actual columns in the backend. Page builders are also great, but we didn't want to hijack the content editor and we wanted to find a way to do it using the existing visual editor that everyone knows.

*Check out the screenshots to see how Shortcodeless Columns works.*

= What it does =

Extends your visual editor to include page builder capabilities

= What can you do with it =

* Create editable, nestable columns
* Drag and drop content into other locations (except text since you can copy/paste them anyway)
* Clone shortcodes & columns
* Create different shortcodes (no shortcodes are included yet, contributions are welcome at the [Github repository](https://github.com/gambitph/Page-Builder-Sandwich/) )
