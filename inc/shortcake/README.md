Shortcake makes using WordPress shortcodes a piece of cake.

## Description ##

Used alongside `add_shortcode`, Shortcake supplies a user-friendly interface for adding a shortcode to a post, and viewing and editing it from within the content editor.

Once you've installed the plugin, you'll need to [register UI for your shortcodes](https://github.com/fusioneng/Shortcake/wiki/Registering-Shortcode-UI). For inspiration, check out [examples of Shortcake in the wild](https://github.com/fusioneng/Shortcake/wiki/Shortcode-UI-Examples).

To report bugs or feature requests, [please use Github issues](https://github.com/fusioneng/Shortcake/issues).

## Installation ##

Shortcake can be installed like any other WordPress plugin.

Once you've done so, you'll need to [register the UI for your code](https://github.com/fusioneng/Shortcake/wiki/Registering-Shortcode-UI).
